# Asteroid-War

Here you can find the repository for the game "Asteroids War".

* To do this work, I based on youtube videos, the multimedia images I used some from the repository that you left me.

* Remember to make the game work correctly, know where you save the images and sounds of the file, since you must update that address inside the Utils code in the method   called "load_sprite" to update the address of the images, and in the method called "load_sound" to update the address of the sound of the laser.
